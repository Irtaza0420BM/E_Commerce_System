Employee Creation
The creation of new employees is a significant aspect of human resource management. This process involves several steps,
I made a Schema called Employee, with the following attributes:
- id (primary key), Name, Cnic, Address, Contact, Job, Salary, Department, Date of Joining, Date of Birth, Mar
My function , Register, takes in the required parameters and inserts a new employee into the database.
Now for login
    In login first they will ask for Email and Password
    Then we will check if the email exists in the database or not
    If the email exists then we will check the password
    If the password is correct then we will Check if he is Verified by Admin or not, basically real employee or not.
